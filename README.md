# Genetic Algorithm for Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem

Repository initially forked from https://github.com/Anupal/GA-for-mTSP.

---

Here graph is covered using different agents having different routes. Routes only intersect at initial node.
Code is provided for both TSP and mTSP.

  * Nomenclature is different with the terms 'dustbin' and 'route' being used for 'city' and 'tour' respectively.

  - The results are good for large number of nodes
  - Values of numGenerations, numTrucks, mutationRate and populationSize can be tweaked to
    reach satisfactory results.
